# Autonomous Cars
I developed an Arduino-based obstacle-avoidance car by integrating components like an ultrasonic sensor, motor driver, and wheels on an Arduino board. I programmed the Arduino to read distance measurements from the sensor, enabling the car to detect and avoid obstacles by dynamically adjusting its path. This project was instrumental in setting the foundation for autonomous vehicle technology, as it required mastery of sensor integration, decision-making algorithms, and robotics. Through this project, I gained the expertise needed to represent my country at the World Robotics Olympiad (WRO) on three occasions, showcasing advancements in autonomous technology.
